iBAP: A Path to BAP Certification

The iBAP program is an optional precursor to BAP certification. The “i” stands for “improver.” It’s an opportunity for aquaculture facilities to be recognized by the marketplace as they improve their practices. The iBAP program provides the encouragement and incentive necessary to apply for BAP certification.

Facilities that enroll in the iBAP program receive technical support and agree to a step-by-step, deadline-driven plan as they prepare for full BAP certification. As less than 10% of global aquaculture production is currently third-party certified, the iBAP program opens doors for retailers and foodservice operators to source more responsibly farmed seafood.

The iBAP program is open to the entire aquaculture supply chain, including farms, processing plants, hatcheries and feed mills. Facilities can apply directly or through organizations acting on their behalf, such as a processor or buyer. *Questions?* Contact ibap@bapcertification.org <mailto:ibap@bapcertification.org>.
