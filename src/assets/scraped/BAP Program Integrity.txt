
BAP Program Integrity


Aquaculture Quality Assurance

We’ve structured our program to ensure the highest level of integrity, with a team of staff members dedicated to ensuring that independent, third-party certification bodies (CBs) and auditors as well as BAP-certified aquaculture facilities are in compliance with program requirements.

To be recognized by BAP, CBs must be accredited under ISO/IEC Guide 17065 by an International Accreditation Forum-member accreditation body and a Multilateral Recognition Arrangements signatory to another internationally recognized scheme.


Auditors must be trained and accredited by the BAP program integrity team in order to audit a facility against the BAP standards. CBs, auditors and facilities are subject to announced and unannounced onsite audits as well as desktop audits, and all are subject to suspension for non-compliance.

We maintain a logo-approval and logo-policing process, to ensure that the BAP logo is being used appropriately. Complaints, appeals and disputes regarding certification brought to the attention of BAP are handled by BAP or referred to the CB involved, depending on the nature of the complaint. If you require a facility’s summary audit report, please contact the certification body directly or program integrity for referral.

Multi-Star Integrity

The BAP program employs a star system to signify the integration levels of BAP certification along the aquaculture production chain. These stars are displayed on the BAP logo and appear on packaging for a variety of farmed seafood products worldwide.

Download the BAP Logo Use Guide to ensure that you’re using the BAP logo appropriately and that any claims associated with GAA or BAP are portrayed in an accurate manner.
