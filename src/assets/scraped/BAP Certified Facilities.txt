BAP-Certified Aquaculture Facilities


The following is a list of all BAP-certified farms, hatcheries, feed mills, processing plants and repacking plants. The BAP program recognizes product from associated or integrated facilities along the aquaculture production chain with a star-based ranking system, which can be found by rolling over a plant’s row in the table. “Facilities in process” refers to a certified facility that is past its expiration date but actively engaged in the re-certification process, while “fallow” refers to   ite not currently in production or in the early stages of production that will complete re-certification at a later date.

To find facilities, filter the list using the dropdown menus to sort by facility type, species or country, or use the search field. The list can be copied, saved as a PDF or Excel file (.csv), or printed.
