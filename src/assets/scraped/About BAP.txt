
About Best Aquaculture Practices

Why BAP Certification?

* *We're well-respected in our industry.*The Best Aquaculture Practices is the only third-party aquaculture certification program to be compliant with the Global Food Safety Initiative (GFSI), Global Social Compliance Programme (GSCP) and Global Sustainable Seafood Initiative (GSSI).

* *We’re your seafood supply chain solution* – a “one-stop shop” for certification. Producers appreciate the time saved from having to patch together various certification programs to cover only a portion of what our BAP standards cover.

* *We are market-driven*. Our market development team actively promotes the advantages of BAP certification to an influential network of retailers and foodservice operators on behalf of all BAP-certified facilities.

* *BAP certification is administered by the Global Aquaculture Alliance (GAA)*, a nonprofit organization dedicated to advocacy, education and leadership in responsible aquaculture. GAA continually invests in advocacy initiatives – including addressing the 95% of aquaculture facilities worldwide that are not yet third-party certified.
