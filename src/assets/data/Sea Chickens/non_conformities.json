Juree Farm Group owner (Somboon's family) explained to\r\nthe auditor that they have already discussed with the authority who\r\nissued the work permit to reissue; however, the authority verbally said\r\nthey can used these cards together with the permit letter to recruit the\r\nimmigration workers. When the auditor reviewed the permit letter, it\r\nindicated that Juree Farm Group got permission to recruit total 80\r\nworkers in order to work for plantation in Chanthaburi about 8 workers\r\nand for shrimp farm in Chanthaburi about 72 workers. The letter\r\nindicated the working place in Rayong province as well, but worker\r\nrequest to work in Rayong province areas indicated as 0 workers.\r\nBased on these documents, it seems the work permits for 4 Laos\r\nworkers who currently worked in Juree 31 are in doubt.\r\nThere are 10 workers in this farm (4 Thai workers and 6 Laos workers).\r\nThe copies of ID card for Thai workers and copies of work permits for\r\nLaos workers were available for review.",
